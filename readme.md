**Bulk Deleter by Date** provides a simple, intuitive, and powerful interface to solve this problem. It allows you to select a content type (Comments or Attachments), choose a start and end date, and permanently delete all matching items in a single operation. It includes a crucial confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions and provides a detailed log of every item removed.
